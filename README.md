# Radix UI
An open-source UI component library for building high-quality, accessible design systems and web apps.
- **Accessible**: Components adhere to the [WAI-ARIA design patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/#aria_ex) where possible.
- **Unstyled**: Components have zero styles, giving complete control to the developer.
- **Opened**: Primitives have a open component architecture allowing for granular access to each component part.
- **Uncontrolled**: Components are uncontrolled bu default but can be controlled through internal handlers.
- **Developer experience**: main goal is to provide the best possible developer experience.
- **Incremental adoption**: Each primitive can be installed individually for incremental adoption.
